Ben Barksdale Demo Static Site
==============================

The purpose of this site is demonstrate my skills related to static site generation, CI/CD pipelines powered by GitHub Actions, and working in reStructuredText and Markdown. I employ the `MyST parser <https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, which allows me to work in both markdown languages within this site.

The primary content page is the first one listed below. The second one demonstrates some of the features of Markdown. The remaining two are there only to fill out the table of contents.
