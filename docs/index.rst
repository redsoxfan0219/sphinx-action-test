Ben Barksdale Demo Static Site
==============================

The purpose of this site is demonstrate my skills related to static site generation, CI/CD pipelines powered by GitHub Actions, and working in reStructuredText and Markdown. I employ the `MyST parser <https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, which allows me to work in both markdown languages within this site.

The site pages themselves contain dummy text and are really only there to fill out the table of contents below.
